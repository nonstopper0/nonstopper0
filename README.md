# Nathaniel Redmon | Full-Stack Developer and Software Engineer.

Hey I'm Nathaniel, I work primarily as a Web Developer but I enjoy doing and learning all things when it comes to tech. A regular off-day consists of working on my game in **Unity** with **c#**, automating my life with **Python**, and working on my web application with **Javascript**. Unfortunately most of my repositories are not public due to security reasons but feel free to explore what I have. <br />
